# About the Author {.unnumbered}

**Algimantas Krasauskas** is an independent researcher and writer focused on the intersection of religion, extremism, and geopolitics. This book emerged from a personal quest to understand the complex historical and theological roots of modern Islamic extremism, moving beyond simplistic narratives to provide nuanced analysis.

Driven by a commitment to fostering understanding across cultural and religious divides, Krasauskas has dedicated extensive research to primary Islamic sources, historical chronicles, and contemporary scholarship. His approach emphasizes contextualization over condemnation, seeking to illuminate the shadow of extremism while honoring the light of Islamic civilization.

**Methodological Innovation**: This book pioneered the use of advanced AI systems (Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude) as research amplifiers—enabling multi-language primary source analysis, comparative pattern recognition across seven religions, and structural refinement—while maintaining human judgment and accountability for all interpretations.

This work is dedicated to Justina Krasauskienė, whose inspiration and passion for helping the world understand these critical issues made this book possible.
