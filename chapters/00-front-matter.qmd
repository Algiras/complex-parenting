## Acknowledgments {.unnumbered}

This book was not written in isolation. It is a quilt stitched together from the stories of hundreds of families who trusted me with their darkest moments.

**To the Clinicians:** Thank you to the psychiatrists, therapists, and researchers who are pushing beyond the "silo" model of diagnosis. Specifically, the work of Dr. Ross Greene, Dr. Ellen Leibenluft, and the researchers at the Bipolar & Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes (BSNIP) has been foundational.

**To the Parents:** To "Elena," "Sarah," "Wei," and the countless others whose real lives inspired the composite families in this book. Your resilience is the spine of this story.

**To the Neurodivergent Community:** Thank you for the language of "neurotypes," "masking," and "burnout." You have given us the words to describe experiences that medicine had no name for.

And finally, to my own family. For the patience, the grace, and the quiet understanding that sometimes, the work comes home with you.
