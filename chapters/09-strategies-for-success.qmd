# Strategies for Success

## The Quarterback Model

You are not just a parent. You are the **CEO** of a small, chaotic non-profit organization called "Your Child's Health."

Your job is to:

- Coordinate the care team (psychiatrist, therapist, school, pediatrician)
- Track medications and side effects
- Translate medical jargon for teachers and family
- Advocate when systems fail

This is **case management**. And you are now a professional.

## Building the Care Team

Your teen needs a team, not a single provider. Here's who should be on it:

### The Core Team
1. **Psychiatrist** (Medication management)
2. **Therapist** (Weekly DBT/CBT for mood regulation, coping skills)
3. **School Counselor or IEP Coordinator** (Academic accommodations)
4. **Pediatrician** (Physical health, blood work, growth monitoring)

### The Extended Team (If Needed)
5. **Neuropsychologist** (Testing for ADHD/Autism if not yet diagnosed)
6. **Occupational Therapist** (Sensory integration for autistic teens)
7. **Social Worker** (Connecting to community resources, insurance navigation)
8. **Crisis Team Contact** (Mobile crisis unit, hospital liaison)

### The Coordinator: YOU

**The Problem:** These providers don't talk to each other. The psychiatrist doesn't know what the therapist is seeing. The school doesn't know about the new medication.

**The Solution:** **You** become the information hub.

## Protocol: The Care Team Meeting Agenda

**Frequency:** Quarterly (every 3 months), or after major changes (new med, hospitalization, IEP update)

**Attendees:** Psychiatrist, therapist, school counselor, you, your teen (if appropriate)

**Format:** 30-minute meeting (can be virtual)

### Pre-Meeting Prep (What to Bring)
- ☐ **Mood Chart** (30-day log showing sleep, mood, incidents)
- ☐ **Medication List** (current doses, start dates, side effects)
- ☐ **School Report** (grades, attendance, behavioral incidents)
- ☐ **Questions/Concerns** (written list so you don't forget mid-meeting)

### Meeting Agenda Template

**1. Check-In (5 min)**
- "How is [Teen] doing overall?"
- Each provider gives 1-minute summary

**2. Data Review (10 min)**
- Share mood chart
- Discuss patterns (e.g., "Mood dips every Monday morning—school-related?")
- Review medication compliance and side effects

**3. Problem-Solving (10 min)**
- Identify biggest current challenge (sleep? school? rage episodes?)
- Brainstorm adjustments (med change? therapy focus shift? school accommodation?)

**4. Action Items (5 min)**
- WHO will do WHAT by WHEN?
   - Example: "Dr. Smith will increase Lamictal to 100mg by next week"
   - Example: "School will implement 'break card' by Monday"
   - Example: "Therapist will work on sleep hygiene for next 4 sessions"

### Sample Questions to Ask
- **To Psychiatrist:** "Should we add/adjust meds based on recent mood data?"
- **To Therapist:** "What coping skills is [Teen] actually using at home?"
- **To School:** "Can we add [specific accommodation] to the IEP?"
- **To Everyone:** "Are we all on the same page about the crisis plan?"

## Technology Tools: Outsourcing Your Brain

You cannot remember everything. Use apps and systems.

### Mood Tracking
- **App:** Daylio, eMoods, or simple Google Sheet
- **What to Track:** Sleep hours, mood (1-10 scale), incidents (rage, crying, self-harm)
- **Frequency:** Daily (set phone reminder for 8 PM)
- **Why:** Patterns emerge over weeks. You'll spot triggers psychiatrist would miss.

### Medication Management
- **App:** Medisafe, Round Health
- **Features:** Reminders, refill alerts, side effect logs
- **Why:** Teens forget. Parents forget. Apps don't.

### School Communication
- **System:** Shared Google Doc with school counselor
- **Update:** Weekly (Fridays) - Brief summary of teen's week at home
- **Why:** School sees half the picture. You see the other half. Share it.

### Crisis Contacts (Phone + Paper)
Create a **Crisis Card** (size of credit card, laminated, in wallet):

![Crisis Card Template](images/crisis_card_template_1764303717469.png)

**Give copies to:** School nurse, grandparents, babysitters, teen (to carry)

## School Accommodations: The IEP Cheat Sheet

Your teen's IEP should address **all three** conditions (Bipolar, ADHD, Autism). Most schools only address one. **Push back.**

### Mood-Related Accommodations (Bipolar)
- ☐ Flexible deadlines during documented mood episodes
- ☐ Daily "mood check-in" with counselor (1-2 min, not punitive)
- ☐ Excused absences for mental health crises/appointments
- ☐ "Safe person" to check in with when dysregulated

### Executive Function Support (ADHD)
- ☐ Extended time on tests (1.5x)
- ☐ Chunked assignments (break long projects into daily tasks)
- ☐ Copies of notes or lecture recordings
- ☐ Use of planner + weekly check-in with teacher

### Sensory/Social Support (Autism)
- ☐ "Break card" (leave class without explanation when overwhelmed)
- ☐ Preferential seating (away from fluorescent lights, near exit)
- ☐ Modified lunch (eat in quiet space if cafeteria is overwhelming)
- ☐ Advance notice of schedule changes

**For full IEP sample language, see Appendix C.**

## Communication Protocols

### Parent → Psychiatrist
**When to Contact:**
- Urgent (call/page): Suicidal ideation, violence, psychosis
- Soon (call within 24h): New side effect, 3+ days no sleep
- Routine (email/portal): Questions about dosing, refills

**What to Include:**
- Brief summary: "Leo hasn't slept in 3 days, very irritable, talking fast"
- Current dose: "On 900mg Lithium, 100mg Lamictal"
- Request: "Should we increase mood stabilizer or bring him in?"

### Parent → School
**Weekly Update Template (Email):**

Subject: [Teen Name] Weekly Update - [Date]

Hi [Counselor Name],

Quick update on [Teen]:

- **Mood:** Stable this week / Had depressive dip Tue-Thu / Hypomanic energy Mon-Wed
- **Sleep:** Getting 7hrs average / Only 4hrs last 3 nights
- **Medications:** No changes / Started new dose [X] on [date]
- **Concerns:** None / Watch for [specific behavior]

Let me know if you see anything concerning on your end. Thanks!

### Parent → Extended Family (Boundaries)
**Script:**

"We appreciate your concern about [Teen]. We're working with a team of doctors and following their treatment plan. If you'd like to help, here's what would be most useful: [specific ask, e.g., 'Take sibling for afternoon once a week,' 'Don't comment on Teen's appearance/behavior']. If that doesn't work for you, we understand, but we won't be discussing the treatment plan further."

## Self-Advocacy: Teaching Your Teen

Eventually, your teen needs to manage their own care. Start now (age-appropriately).

### Ages 13-14: Awareness
- **Teach:** Names of medications, why they take them
- **Practice:** "Can you tell Dr. Smith how you've been sleeping?"
- **Goal:** Teen can describe symptoms to doctor (with you there)

### Ages 15-16: Participation
- **Teach:** Side effects to watch for, when to ask for help
- **Practice:** Teen calls/texts you when feeling "off"
- **Goal:** Teen actively participates in doctor visits (not just you talking)

### Ages 17-18: Transition Prep
- **Teach:** How to refill prescriptions, schedule appointments, use insurance
- **Practice:** Teen makes one appointment on their own (you supervise)
- **Goal:** Teen can manage care with minimal parent involvement (ready for college/adulthood)

## The Takeaway

Success in managing the "Double Diagnosis" requires:
1. **A coordinated care team** (quarterly meetings, shared information)
2. **Technology tools** (mood tracking, med reminders, crisis cards)
3. **School advocacy** (IEPs that address ALL conditions)
4. **Clear communication** (protocols for when/how to contact providers)
5. **Self-advocacy training** (age-appropriate independence building)

You are the Quarterback. The plays are complex.  The team doesn't always coordinate. But YOU keep the game moving forward.

**And that makes all the difference.**
