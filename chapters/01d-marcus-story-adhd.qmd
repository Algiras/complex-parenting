# Marcus's Story - Understanding ADHD Alone

## Meet Marcus

Marcus is 14, neurotypical (no autism), no mood disorder. He's friendly, socially aware, loves his friends. But he has ADHD.

## 7:00 AM: The Morning Chaos

Marcus's alarm goes off. He hits snooze. 20 minutes later, his mom yells, "MARCUS! YOU'RE GOING TO BE LATE!"

He jumps out of bed, scrambles to find his shoes (they're under the couch—somehow). He can't find his homework. "I know I did it! Where IS it??" (It's in his locker at school. He forgot to bring it home.)

He grabs a Pop-Tart, forgets his lunch on the counter, and runs to catch the bus.

## 9:00 AM: Math Class

The teacher is explaining quadratic equations. Marcus is looking at her, but he's not *hearing* her. He's thinking about:

- The cool sneakers he saw yesterday
- That funny TikTok his friend showed him
- Whether he'll make the basketball team
- "Wait, what did she just say?"

He snaps back to attention. The teacher is handing out a worksheet. He has no idea what to do. He looks at his neighbor's paper and copies the first problem. Then he gets distracted tapping his pencil. *Tap tap tap tap*.

"Marcus, stop," the teacher says.
He didn't even realize he was doing it.

## 12:00 PM: Lunch

Marcus is in the cafeteria with his friends. They're talking about the school dance next week. Suddenly, Marcus interrupts. "DUDE, I just remembered the funniest thing that happened in gym yesterday—"

"Marcus, we're literally in the middle of talking about—"
"Sorry sorry, what were you saying?"

His friends laugh. This is just Marcus. He doesn't *mean* to interrupt. He just... does.

## 3:00 PM: Homework (Or Lack Thereof)

Marcus sits down to do his homework. He opens his backpack. No textbook. He forgot it. Again.

"Fine, I'll just play video games for 10 minutes, THEN I'll do homework."
3 hours later, his mom finds him still gaming. "MARCUS! Your homework!"
"I'm doing it!" (He's not.)

## 8:00 PM: The Guilt

Marcus finally starts his homework. He's frustrated. "Why can't I just DO it like everyone else? Why is this so hard?"

He finishes half of it, gives up, and goes to bed feeling like a failure.

## But Notice: Marcus's Mood is STABLE

- He's frustrated, sure. But he's not cycling into weeks of euphoria or weeks of crushing depression.
- If his friend makes him mad at lunch, he's mad for 5 minutes, then he's fine.
- He doesn't have *mood episodes*—he has *focus issues*.

## What We Just Witnessed: Symptom Summary

### Inattention
- **✓ Difficulty Sustaining Attention:** Drifts off during math class despite trying to listen
- **✓ Easily Distracted:** Thinking about sneakers, TikTok, basketball instead of the lesson
- **✓ Loses Things:** Homework in locker, lunch on counter, textbook forgotten
- **✓ Forgetful:** Didn't remember to bring homework home, forgot textbook
- **✓ Difficulty Following Through:** Starts homework → ends up gaming for 3 hours

### Hyperactivity
- **✓ Fidgeting:** Tapping pencil without realizing it
- **✓ Can't Sit Still:** (Implied - typical ADHD)
- **✓ "Always On the Go":** Rushing in the morning, constant activity

### Impulsivity
- **✓ Interrupts Others:** Cuts off friends mid-conversation
- **✓ Acts Without Thinking:** Hits snooze multiple times, then rushes
- **✓ Difficulty Waiting Turn:** Blurts out thoughts

### Emotional Dysregulation (ADHD-Style)
- **✓ Quick Emotional Spikes:** Gets mad → 5 minutes later, fine
- **✓ Frustration Intolerance:** Homework feels impossible, gives up
- **✓ BUT:** No sustained mood episodes (key difference from Bipolar)

## What ADHD Does NOT Cause (In Marcus's Case)

- **✗ Sustained Euphoria/Mania:** Marcus doesn't go days without sleep feeling "amazing"
- **✗ Sustained Depression:** He doesn't have weeks of crushing hopelessness
- **✗ Psych osis:** No hallucinations or delusions
- **✗ Sensory Sensitivities:** Fine with loud cafeteria, bright lights (no Autism)
- **✗ Rigid Routines:** He's spontaneous and flexible (no Autism)

## The Key Takeaway

ADHD is about **executive function deficits** that are present every day. Marcus doesn't cycle into different mood states (Bipolar) or have sensory sensitivities (Autism). His challenge is the **chronic difficulty** with attention, organization, and impulse control.
