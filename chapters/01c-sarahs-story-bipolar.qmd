# Sarah's Story - Understanding Bipolar Disorder Alone

## Meet Sarah

Sarah is 16, a junior in high school. She's smart, articulate, socially fluent, and has no sensory issues or attention problems. But she has Bipolar I Disorder.

## Monday: The Climb Begins

Sarah wakes up at 4 AM—unusual for a teenager. She feels *amazing*. Ideas are flooding her brain. "I should reorganize my entire Notion workspace. No, I should start a podcast about teen mental health. No wait, I should write a book AND start a podcast!"

She makes coffee (her parents don't know she drinks it), and she's WIRED. She works on a school project for 4 hours straight without a break, doesn't eat breakfast. Her mom comes in to tell her it's time for school.

"Mom, I've been SO productive! I finished the history project, redesigned my entire room layout on paper, and I'm going to audition for the spring musical even though auditions are in January!"

"Sarah... it's November. And you told me last week you hate musicals."

"I LOVE musicals now! I'm going to be AMAZING!"

## Tuesday: The Acceleration at School

Sarah slept 2 hours last night. She's not tired. At lunch, she talks non-stop to her friends about her "brilliant" plan to start a YouTube channel, an Etsy shop, and maybe run for student council—all at once.

Her friend Jenna tries to interrupt. "Sarah, you're talking really fast and—"

"I KNOW, RIGHT? I have SO MANY IDEAS!" Sarah interrupts back, louder.

In English class, she raises her hand constantly, interrupting the teacher mid-sentence with tangential observations. "Mrs. Lopez, did you know that Hamlet is basically just a 16th-century emo kid? Like, if he had a Tumblr—"

"Sarah, please let me finish."

Later, Sarah spends her entire allowance plus her birthday money ($200) on art supplies for the Etsy shop she's starting. She's never done crafts before, but she's convinced she'll be "the next big thing."

## Wednesday: The Peak

Sarah hasn't slept in 48 hours. At 2 AM, her parents find her reorganizing the kitchen cabinets "because the system is inefficient."

Her dad, Mike, calls their psychiatrist. "She's been up for two days. She won't stop moving. She yelled at her brother for breathing too loud."

"Does she seem irritable or euphoric?" the doctor asks.

"Both. She's laughing one minute, then screaming the next."

Sarah maxes out her debit card buying a professional camera and editing software for the YouTube channel that doesn't exist yet.

## Thursday: The Crash Begins

The doctor increased Sarah's mood stabilizer yesterday. She's starting to "come down." The euphoria is fading, replaced by... nothing.

She wakes up at 2 PM (missed school). She's exhausted. The art supplies are still in bags. She looks at her bank account and starts crying. "What did I do? I'm so stupid."

## Friday-Sunday: The Aftermath

Sarah can't get out of bed. She's not sad, exactly—she's *empty*. Her mom brings her food; she doesn't eat it. She thinks, "I ruined everything. Everyone at school thinks I'm crazy. I can't go back. There's no point."

She texts her friends she's sick. She doesn't shower. She just stares at her phone, scrolling but not really seeing anything.

## What We Just Witnessed: Symptom Summary

### Mania (Monday-Wednesday)
- **✓ Elevated Mood:** "I'm going to be AMAZING!"
- **✓ Decreased Need for Sleep:** 2 hours → 0 hours, no fatigue
- **✓ Grandiosity:** "I'll be the next big thing" (never done crafts before)
- **✓ Racing Thoughts:** Jumping from podcast to book to Etsy shop to student council
- **✓ Excessive Goal-Directed Activity:** Working 4 hours straight, reorganizing kitchen at 2 AM
- **✓ Impulsive Spending:** $200+ on art/camera supplies
- **✓ Increased Talkativeness:** Talking non-stop, interrupting friends and teacher
- **✓ Irritability:** Yelling at brother for "breathing too loud"

### Depression (Friday-Sunday)
- **✓ Depressed Mood:** Empty, hopeless ("There's no point")
- **✓ Loss of Interest:** Art supplies still in bags
- **✓ Fatigue:** Can't get out of bed
- **✓ Worthlessness:** "I'm so stupid. Everyone thinks I'm crazy."
- **✓ Social Withdrawal:** Texting she's sick, won't go to school

## What Bipolar Disorder Does NOT Cause (In Sarah's Case)

Notice what Sarah does NOT have:

- **✗ Sensory Sensitivities:** Not bothered by fluorescent lights, cafeteria noise
- **✗ Social Communication Deficits:** Socially fluent (just talks too much during mania)
- **✗ Need for Routine:** Impulsive and spontaneous (not rigid like autism)
- **✗ Chronic Focus Issues:** Outside of mood episodes, she's a good student (no ADHD)

## The Key Takeaway

Bipolar Disorder is about **sustained mood states** that last days or weeks. Sarah doesn't have moment-to-moment focus issues (ADHD) or sensory sensitivities (Autism). Her challenge is the **cycling** between extreme mood states that disrupt her entire life—school, friends, family, and her own sense of self.
