# Looping Effects: The Digital Feedback Loop

## Ian Hacking's Theory in the TikTok Era
*   **The Theory:** "Human Kinds" (like Bipolar or Trans) are *interactive*. People change their behavior to fit the label they are given.
*   **The Loop:**
    1.  **Classification:** Influencers describe "symptoms" (often oversimplified).
    2.  **Identification:** Vulnerable teens (seeking belonging) identify with the label.
    3.  **Performance:** They unconsciously adopt more of the behaviors to "validate" their membership in the group.
    4.  **Reinforcement:** Algorithms feed them more of that content, creating a "confirmation bias loop."

## The "Sick Role" Subculture
*   **Community via Diagnosis:** For lonely teens, a diagnosis (DID, Bipolar, Autism) offers instant community and validation.
*   **Symptom Pool:** The "language of distress" changes. Teens now use clinical terms ("dissociating," "stimming," "splitting") to describe normal emotional fluctuations.
*   **Risk:** "Self-diagnosis" becomes a rigid identity that resists professional correction ("The doctor is gaslighting me; I know I have X").
