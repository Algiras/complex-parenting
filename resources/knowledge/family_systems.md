# Family Systems Theory: The Mobile in the Storm

## The System
A family is like a mobile. If one piece (the teen) moves wildly (mania/transition), the entire mobile spins. The family seeks **Homeostasis** (balance).

## Key Dynamics
1.  **The Identified Patient:** The family focuses all anxiety on the "sick" child. This stabilizes the parents' marriage or other siblings by distracting from other problems.
    *   *Risk:* The teen *stays* sick to maintain the family function.
2.  **Differentiation of Self (Bowen):**
    *   **Low Differentiation:** Parents and teen are emotionally fused. "If you are sad, I am devastated." This makes objective parenting impossible during mania.
    *   **High Differentiation:** "I can love you and be close to you, but your emotional storm does not have to become my storm." This is the goal for parents of bipolar teens.
3.  **Triangulation:**
    *   Dad says "No," Teen goes to Mom.
    *   Teen goes to Therapist to complain about Parents.
    *   *Solution:* Parents must present a "United Front."

## Resilience Factors
*   **Flexibility:** Families that can adapt roles (e.g., Dad takes over emotional support, Mom takes over logistics) survive better.
*   **Meaning-Making:** Families that view the diagnosis as a "challenge we face together" rather than a "curse on our house" have better outcomes.
