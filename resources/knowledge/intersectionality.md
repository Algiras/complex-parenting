# Intersectionality: The "Double Rainbow" of Neurodivergence & Gender

## The Concept
Intersectionality (Crenshaw) explains how overlapping identities create unique modes of discrimination. For a teen who is **Autistic + Bipolar + Transgender**, these are not separate buckets; they are a compounded experience.

## The Neuroqueer Connection
*   **Statistics:** Autistic people are 3-6x more likely to be gender diverse.
*   **Theory:** Neurodivergent minds are less bound by social norms (including gender roles). This isn't "confusion"; it's a refusal to perform arbitrary social rules.
*   **Minority Stress:** The stress of being autistic (masking) + the stress of being trans (closeting) + the stress of bipolar (mood instability) creates a "super-additive" risk for burnout and suicidality.

## Clinical Implication
Treating the "trans" part without understanding the "autistic" processing style (e.g., literal thinking, sensory dysphoria) will fail. The approach must be **neuro-affirming**.
