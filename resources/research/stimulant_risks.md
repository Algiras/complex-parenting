# The "Stimulant Trap": ADHD Meds & Bipolar

## The Risk
*   **Monotherapy Danger:** Treating ADHD with stimulants (Ritalin, Adderall) *alone* in a Bipolar teen increases the risk of manic induction by 6-7x.
*   **The "Switch":** Stimulants can flip a depressed or stable Bipolar teen into full-blown mania or psychosis.

## The Safety Protocol
*   **"Mood First":** Clinical consensus is to stabilize the mood (Lithium, Lamictal, Antipsychotics) *before* treating the focus.
*   **Combination Therapy:** Once mood is stable, adding a stimulant is generally safe and effective.
*   **Monitoring:** Watch for "activation" symptoms (insomnia, irritability, racing thoughts) immediately after starting stimulants.

## Impact on Onset
*   **Acceleration:** Some evidence suggests early stimulant use in misdiagnosed Bipolar kids may accelerate the onset of the full disorder.
