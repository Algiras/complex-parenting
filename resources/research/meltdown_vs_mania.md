# Meltdown vs. Mania: The Clinical Distinction

## The Confusion
Both look like "explosive rage" or "loss of control." Parents often can't tell them apart.

## Key Differences

| Feature | Autistic Meltdown | Bipolar Manic Rage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trigger** | **Reactive:** Sensory overload, routine change, social demand. | **Endogenous:** Often unprovoked, or sleep-deprivation induced. |
| **Duration** | **Acute:** Minutes to hours. Ends when trigger is removed/energy spent. | **Sustained:** Days to weeks. Persists regardless of environment. |
| **Cognition** | **Overwhelmed:** "I can't process this." Shut down or lashing out to escape. | **Grandios/Racing:** "I am god/genius." Flight of ideas, pressured speech. |
| **Aftermath** | **Exhaustion:** Shame, remorse, need for deep rest. | **Continuation:** Remains revved up, or crashes into deep depression. |

## The "Rumbling" Stage
*   **Meltdown:** Preceded by visible anxiety, pacing, "stimming" increase.
*   **Mania:** Preceded by decreased sleep, increased goal-directed activity, hyper-social behavior.
