# Sleep Regulation: The Foundation of Stability

## The Protocol
Sleep is the single most critical factor in managing bipolar disorder. Disrupted sleep is both a *trigger* for and a *symptom* of mania.

## Dark Therapy & Blue Light
*   **The Science:** Blue light suppresses melatonin. Bipolar individuals are often hypersensitive to light disruption.
*   **"Virtual Darkness":** Using blue-light blocking (amber) glasses in the evening.
    *   **Protocol:** Wear glasses starting at 6 PM (or 2 hours before bed) until sleep.
    *   **Effect:** Can rapidly reduce manic symptoms by stabilizing circadian rhythms without medication side effects.
*   **Environment:** Pitch dark bedroom (blackout curtains), cool temperature.

## Routine is Medicine
*   **Social Rhythm Therapy:** Waking up, eating, and sleeping at the *exact same time* every day (including weekends) anchors the body's biological clock.
*   **Wind-Down:** 60-minute buffer zone before bed with NO screens.
