# Sensory Processing: The Bipolar Amplifier

## The "Suprasensitivity" of Mania
*   **Hypersensitivity:** During mania/hypomania, 82% of patients report heightened senses.
    *   *Vision:* Colors look brighter, sharper.
    *   *Sound:* Noises are louder, music is more profound.
    *   *Smell/Taste:* Intense, sometimes overwhelming.
*   **The AuDHD Collision:** For an autistic teen who is *already* sensitive, mania turns the world into an unbearable assault. This fuels the "Manic Rage" (lashing out to stop the noise).

## Depression & Dulling
*   **Hyposensitivity:** During depression, the world feels "flat," "gray," or "muted." Food tastes like cardboard.
*   **Sensory Seeking:** Some teens may engage in high-risk behaviors (cutting, binge eating) just to *feel* something.

## Clinical Implication
*   **Sensory Diet:** "Low stimulation" is not just for autism; it is a critical medical intervention for mania.
*   **Prodrome Watch:** Sudden complaints about "loud lights" or "itchy clothes" can be an early warning sign of a manic episode.
