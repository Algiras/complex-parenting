# Diagnostic Overshadowing: Hiding in Plain Sight

## The Phenomenon
"Diagnostic Overshadowing" occurs when clinicians attribute *all* symptoms to the primary diagnosis (Autism), missing the co-occurring condition (Bipolar).

## How Autism Hides Bipolar
1.  **"It's just regression":** Manic irritability is dismissed as "autistic regression" or "behavioral worsening."
2.  **"Special Interest" vs. Mania:** An intense obsession with a new topic (Mania) is dismissed as a "Special Interest" (Autism).
    *   *Difference:* Special interests are usually long-standing. Manic obsessions are sudden, intense, and often discarded when the episode ends.
3.  **Communication Barriers:** Autistic teens with alexithymia (inability to name emotions) cannot say "I feel euphoric," so they act out.

## The Consequence
*   **Delayed Treatment:** Bipolar goes untreated for years, leading to worsening cycles.
*   **Wrong Meds:** Teens are given SSRIs (for "autistic anxiety") which trigger mania, or antipsychotics (for "behavior") without mood stabilization.
