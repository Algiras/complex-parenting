# The "Bipolar Blur": Mania vs. Identity

## Clinical Differentiation
The core challenge is distinguishing **Mania-Induced Gender Dysphoria** from **Comorbid Gender Dysphoria**.

### Mania-Induced (Transient)
*   **Temporality:** Emerges *only* during acute manic/hypomanic episodes.
*   **Resolution:** Disappears or significantly diminishes when mood is stabilized (e.g., with Lithium/Valproate).
*   **Nature:** Often linked to hypersexuality, grandiosity, or disinhibition ("unmasking" suppressed thoughts but in a distorted way).
*   **Case Reports:** Documented cases of "desire for sex reassignment" vanishing after manic episodes are treated.

### Comorbid (Persistent)
*   **Temporality:** Present during euthymia (stable mood), depression, and mania.
*   **Resolution:** Does *not* resolve with mood stabilizers alone. Requires gender-affirming care.
*   **Nature:** Deeply held, consistent incongruence independent of energy levels or impulsivity.

## The "Watchful Waiting" Protocol
*   **Guideline:** Do not start irreversible medical transition (hormones/surgery) during an active manic or mixed episode.
*   **Strategy:** "Affirm socially, wait medically." Allow the teen to express gender (clothes, names) while aggressively treating the mood. If the identity persists after 3-6 months of stability, it is likely genuine.
