# De-escalation: Managing Manic Rage

## Understanding "Bipolar Rage"
In teens, mania often looks like **explosive irritability** or rage rather than euphoria. This is a medical symptom ("aggressive depression"), not just "bad behavior."

## Parent Strategies
1.  **Low Stimulation Zone:**
    *   Dim lights, lower voices, remove audience (siblings).
    *   Reduce sensory input to help the overloaded brain calm down.
2.  **Strategic Disengagement:**
    *   **The Rule:** Do not argue with mania. Logic does not work during an episode.
    *   **Code Word:** Use a family signal to stop a heated conversation before it explodes.
    *   **Neutrality:** Maintain a "boring," calm face and tone. Emotion feeds the fire.
3.  **Safety First:**
    *   Remove dangerous objects.
    *   Have a clear safety plan: "If X happens, we call Y."
    *   **Physical Outlets:** safely channel energy (running, punching bag) rather than suppressing it.
4.  **Post-Episode:**
    *   Discuss consequences only *after* stability returns.
    *   Focus on the *illness* as the enemy, not the teen.
