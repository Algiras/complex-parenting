# Lifestyle Impacts: Cannabis & Social Media on Bipolar Teens

## Cannabis: The "Accelerant"
*   **Risk Factor:** Teen cannabis use is an independent risk factor for developing mania.
*   **Impact on Bipolar Course:**
    *   **Earlier Onset:** Heavy use can accelerate the onset of bipolar symptoms by several years.
    *   **Worsened Mania:** Linked to longer, more frequent, and more severe manic episodes.
    *   **Rapid Cycling:** Increases the likelihood of rapid cycling between mood states.
*   **Neurobiology:** The teen brain's prefrontal cortex is still developing; cannabis interferes with this, worsening the impulsivity already present in bipolar disorder.

## Social Media: The "Digital Dopamine Loop"
*   **Algorithm Trap:** Algorithms prioritize high-engagement, emotional content. For a manic teen, this creates a feedback loop of sensationalism and outrage.
*   **Sleep Disruption:** "Doomscrolling" and blue light exposure disrupt sleep, a primary trigger for mania.
*   **Manic Behaviors Online:**
    *   **Oversharing:** Posting impulsive, personal, or inappropriate content during mania.
    *   **Hypersexuality:** Sexting or seeking risky connections online.
    *   **Comparison:** Constant comparison fuels depression and inadequacy during crash phases.
