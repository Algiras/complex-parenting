# Medical Interactions: Mood Stabilizers & Hormone Therapy

## Overview
Navigating gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alongside bipolar medication requires careful management due to drug-drug interactions and the direct mood effects of hormones.

## Testosterone (Transmasculine)
*   **Mood Effects:** High doses can induce **mania**, agitation, or irritability, especially in those with underlying bipolar disorder.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   **Lamotrigine:** Generally considered safe, but some anecdotal reports suggest dose adjustments may be needed.
    *   **Lithium:** Levels need monitoring as testosterone can affect fluid balance/kidney function.
*   **Clinical Note:** "Testosterone rage" is often a myth at therapeutic levels, but *fluctuating* levels (e.g., end of injection cycle) can destabilize mood.

## Estrogen (Transfeminine)
*   **Mood Effects:** Complex. Can be mood-stabilizing for some but may induce mania or worsen depression in others.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   **Lamotrigine:** **CRITICAL INTERACTION.** Estrogen increases the clearance of lamotrigine (glucuronidation), significantly **lowering** blood levels.
        *   *Action:* Lamotrigine dose often needs to be **increased** when starting estrogen to maintain therapeutic effect.
    *   **Valproate:** Potential interaction; requires monitoring.
    *   **Carbamazepine:** Can decrease estrogen levels (enzyme inducer), making HRT less effective.

## General Guidelines
*   **"Start Low, Go Slow":** Hormone titration should be gradual to monitor mood stability.
*   **Integrated Care:** Endocrinologists and Psychiatrists *must* communicate. One treating the hormones and one treating the mood without coordination is dangerous.
*   **Stability First:** Most guidelines suggest mood should be relatively stable before starting hormones, but for some, the dysphoria *causes* the instability, creating a "chicken and egg" problem.
